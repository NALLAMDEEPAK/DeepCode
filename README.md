# DeepCode
DeepCode is a full-stack, interactive coding platform built for developers to sharpen their problem-solving skills and practice mock interviews. It features a list of DSA questions with tutorials, an in-browser code editor with real-time execution, and a live mock interview space to collaborate, chat, and code with peers â€” all in one platform.
